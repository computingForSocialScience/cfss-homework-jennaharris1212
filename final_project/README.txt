Instructions / Explanations

Due to many issues with mysql, it was very hard to complete this assignment.

If everything had gone smoothly, we would have created a webpage (our index page) that has a list of all of Susanna Tuan's 
Facebook friends. Then you either would have been able to click the name in the list or type in 
http://127.0.0.1:5000/profile/[userid]- if an individual's userid was known - and be able to access a page that had the profile
of that individual user.  On that profile page there would have been a table of that friend's selected attributes that we
pulled from our json file (uid, the name fields, pic, religion, birthday_date, sex, hometown_location, current_location, 
relationship_status, significant_other_id, political, locale, and profile_url). There also would have been a graph of
mutual friends that Susanna had with that friend. 

So in our script that when we were first writing part 1 and creating our create_tables2.py, whenever I ran it in my terminal,
MySQL would not be functional. I recieved help from Piazza, fellow students, and CompSci Harper Tutors, but no matter what 
happened. In the end we simplified the code to 4 attributes instead of the 14 we inteded above in order to attempt to complete 
the rest of the project without being able to test our data.  For this reason, we were unable to complete the project in its
entirety.  

Without data, it was incredibly to continue. Most of our code is hypothetical of our Facebook Networks working application. 
It is hard to determine which variable plugs in to our code which creates the profiles and network graphs for analysis, 
when there is no way to check how our data was imported. For that reason, there are many gaps and placeholder variables in 
this code.  Additionally, it is difficult to predetermine what these variables would be called/how they would be manipulated 
into dataframes to be analysed using pandas and bokeh. The two html codes im my templates folder reflect this as well.

Thank you all so much for your help.
